Decoding Phone Usage Patterns in India

Approach
1. Data Preparation:
Used a dataset containing user IDs, device models, operating systems, and usage statistics.
Merged and preprocessed the dataset to ensure consistency and accuracy.
2. Data Cleaning:
Handled missing values using imputation techniques.
Standardized formats for features like operating systems and device models.
Removed outliers based on statistical thresholds.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed trends in mobile app usage, screen-on time, and battery consumption.
Visualized correlations between features like data usage and battery drain.
Identified patterns in Primary use Class.
4. Machine Learning and Clustering:
Implemented classification models to predict Primary use Class:


Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM) etc.
Applied clustering techniques to group users based on device usage patterns:


K-Means
Hierarchical Clustering
DBSCAN
Gaussian Mixture Models
Spectral Clustering etc.
Evaluate classification models using metrics like precision, recall, and accuracy.


Analyzed clustering performance using silhouette scores and visualization techniques.


5. Application Development:
Build a user-friendly interface using Streamlit to:
Displayed visualizations and insights from EDA.
Allowed users to input data for primary use classification.
Present clustering results and user segmentation.
6. Deployment:
Deployed the Streamlit application for accessibility and user interaction.
